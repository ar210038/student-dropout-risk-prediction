# Final Usability Feature Decision

The validated 12-input Random Forest was compared with an 11-input version using the same training partition and repeated cross-validation. The new form removes Admission Grade and replaces the raw 95–190 Previous Qualification Grade with a native 2.50–5.00 model input:

`previous_academic_gpa_normalized = previous_qualification_grade / 190 × 5`

Examples: 190→5.00, 152→4.00, and 95→2.50. This is only a linear numerical normalization, not a statement that source grades are academically equivalent to Bangladesh HSC GPAs.

Repeated-CV changes for the 11-input Random Forest were ROC-AUC −0.0001, PR-AUC −0.0005, precision −0.0028, recall −0.0004, and F1 −0.0016. These negligible changes support adopting the clearer form.

The 11 visible fields are HSC / Equivalent GPA, Age at Enrollment, both parent occupations, Scholarship Holder, Debtor, Tuition Fees Up to Date, Courses Enrolled, Evaluations Completed, Courses Passed, and Average Semester Grade. Semester pass rate is derived safely as Passed/Enrolled, with zero used when Enrolled is zero.

# Student Dropout Early Warning System Using Machine Learning

This academic project estimates elevated risk of later university dropout after a completed semester. It supports timely review—not automatic decisions or certainty about a student's future.

## Prediction point and target

The prediction point is the **end of the first semester**. The model uses background, financial, and Semester-1 performance information available then.

- Positive class: Dropout = 1
- Negative class: Graduate = 0
- Enrolled students are excluded because their final outcomes are unresolved
- All Semester-2 and final-outcome information is excluded

## Dataset

The project uses the UCI Machine Learning Repository dataset **Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success**.

| Cohort | Students |
|---|---:|
| Original dataset | 4,424 |
| Graduate | 2,209 |
| Dropout | 1,421 |
| Enrolled excluded | 794 |
| Resolved modeling cohort | 3,630 |

Dropout prevalence is 39.15%.

## Final 11-input form

1. HSC / Equivalent GPA
2. Age at Enrollment
3. Mother's Occupation
4. Father's Occupation
5. Scholarship Holder
6. Debtor
7. Tuition Fees Up to Date
8. Courses Enrolled
9. Evaluations Completed
10. Courses Passed
11. Semester GPA (0.00–4.00)

Admission Grade was removed. The source Previous Qualification Grade is normalized during training as `source grade / 190 × 5` and renamed `previous_academic_gpa_normalized`. Its exact observed support is 2.50–5.00, which becomes the website's HSC / Equivalent GPA range. This is a numerical scale normalization only; it does not claim academic equivalence between national grading systems.

Occupation codes are presented as documented readable labels. Semester pass rate is calculated inside the pipeline as `Courses Passed / Courses Enrolled`; zero enrolled courses produces a rate of zero.

For interface compatibility, the visible Semester GPA is converted internally using `source semester grade = semester GPA / 4 × 18.875`. The user never enters or sees the source 0–18.875 value. This numerical normalization does not imply equivalence between Portuguese and Bangladeshi grading systems.

## Model development and results

Preprocessing and feature engineering are contained in a scikit-learn pipeline. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost were compared with repeated stratified cross-validation on training data. The holdout was not used for feature or threshold selection.

The selected model is **Random Forest**, with a locked threshold of **0.48**.

| Held-out metric | Result |
|---|---:|
| Accuracy | 87.6% |
| Balanced accuracy | 87.6% |
| Precision | 81.9% |
| Recall | 87.7% |
| F1 | 84.7% |
| ROC-AUC | 93.8% |
| PR-AUC | 92.9% |
| Brier score | 0.0997 |

Confusion matrix: 387 correctly identified graduates, 55 false early warnings, 35 missed dropout cases, and 249 correctly identified dropout cases. The same holdout had been consulted in earlier project iterations, so these results are a final project benchmark rather than pristine external validation.

## Streamlit interface

The three pages are Home, Assess Dropout Risk, and About Project. The assessment page loads the frozen artifact from `models/uci_sem1/`, calls `predict_proba()`, reads the Dropout=1 probability, and applies the saved threshold. It never retrains.


The source model was trained using first-semester academic performance. The prototype interface presents these fields as the student's most recently completed semester for easier local data collection. Local validation is required before operational use across different semester stages.

## Local data collection plan

A future Google Form should collect the same 11 user fields shown above, plus these research-only fields:

- Current Semester / Academic Year
- Anonymous Follow-Up ID

Unlabeled form responses cannot immediately retrain a supervised model. Future actual outcomes must be linked to each response through the anonymous ID before the data can support local validation, recalibration, or retraining.

## Leakage controls

The final model excludes Target, every Semester-2 variable, final-outcome information, Application Mode, Application Order, Course code, Nationality, unemployment, inflation, and GDP. No information occurring after the prediction point is used.

## Local use

Python 3.12 is the deployment target. The artifact was trained under Python 3.14.5 with scikit-learn 1.9.1; Python 3.12 must be tested independently before deployment.

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest -q --basetemp=.pytest_tmp
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

## Limitations

- Data comes from Portuguese higher education and has not been validated in Bangladesh.
- Academic systems may differ between countries.
- Occupation categories originate from the source dataset.
- Probability calibration may require local recalibration.
- Predictions are estimates, not certainties.
- Outputs should support, not replace, human judgement.
- Operational deployment requires local longitudinal validation or retraining.
